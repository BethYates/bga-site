BGA is an educational tool, however, we can take this a step further and start encouraging newcomers to the field.

Currently, I am reaching out to Universities to see if we could run "Bioinfo Basics" as a series and get their students on board. After all this would cover a wide range of topics that may not normally come up in studies.

I am currently looking for educators on:
- Alignments and Mapping
	- What is it?
	- Algorithms at play
	- Common software in use

- Phylogenetic Tree best practises
	- What is it?
	- How do we make a good, balanced and rooted tree

- Taxonomies
	- Experts of various clades
