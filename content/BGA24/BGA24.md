Like last year we are offering workshops so people can show the community how their project/software/pipeline/analysis can be used and why they should use it. These workshops will, again, be hosted on [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) which is a pretty perfect platform for this use case. Just beware you have 50 hours free, so if you want to tune into every session we hope to host then you may struggle! It is only 6p (British Pennies) per hour after those 50 hours, so not too bad. 

This is BGA at it's core.

### Basic Bioinfo...
However, as this is an educational platform, I am reaching out to Universities to see if we could run a "Basic Bioinfo..." series and whether this is something students would be interested in.

### Long format talks
If people want to run lectures that they feel are too long and too detailed for the short time they may have for the BG conference then this may also be for them. Just beware, that the shear nature of BGA means you will get questions!

### Workshop-tracks
It is all well and good having a grand pool of talks and sessions to dive into. However, once you have taken the dive which direction do you take? Bioinformatics is a rather large topic and so we will be working to create Workshop-tracks. Tracks which offer a realistic and approachable path through a topic.

For example this collection of workshops would enable an attendee to go from contigs to reference genome:

Could have the pathway:

1, Genome Assembly OR VGP-Galaxy - Assemble your contigs into usable assemblies 

2, TreeVal - Generates tracks, maps and annotations useful for manual curation.

3, Manual Curation - The manual manipulation of your assembly, potentially, into a reference standard genome.
