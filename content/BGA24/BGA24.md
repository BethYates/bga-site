## What are we offering?

Like last year we are offering workshops so people can show the community how their project/software/pipeline/analysis can be used and why they should use it. These workshops will, again, be hosted on [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) which is a pretty perfect platform for this use case. Just beware you have 50 hours free, so if you want to tune into every session we hope to host then you may struggle! It is only 3.6p (GBP) per hour after those 50 hours, so not exactly bank breaking. 

This is BGA at its core, however, this year we are also hoping to showcase [[Bioinfo Basics|"BioinfoBasics"]], [[Longformat Lectures| "Longformat talks"]] and most interestingly [[Workflow tracks| "Workflow Tracks"]] (you can hover over these to find out more)!

## When are we offering it?

1st - 26th October 2024

We hope that we will have sessions to ensure that every time zone gets a chance to turn up and 

## What sessions are on board already?
