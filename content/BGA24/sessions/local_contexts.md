## Description

[Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/) is a global non-profit that provides Indigenous communities, institutions, and researchers with tools to support Indigenous data sovereignty and cultural authority in collections and data. 
In this interactive session, the Local Contexts team will introduce their digital labelling tools that operationalize the CARE Principles of Indigenous Data Governance. 
Attendees will participate in a hands-on demonstration of the Local Contexts Hub website, and small group discussions to talk through case studies and technical implementation, including metadata considerations.  

By the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of the CARE Principles and how to implement the Local Contexts tools into various systems. This session would be a meaningful complement to the “Indigenous Data Sovereignty in Biodiversity Genomics” session planned for the BioDiversity Genomics Conference.
