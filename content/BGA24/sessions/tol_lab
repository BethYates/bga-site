## Description
This session will cover the wet lab processes employed by the Tree of Life Core Lab to generate high quality  genomic data. 

We will present recordings of protocols that broadly fit into three categories: 

- Sample preparation and disruption
- DNA and RNA extraction (including QC)
- DNA fragmentation. 

We will finish off by sharing our decision making approach for DNA extractions.
