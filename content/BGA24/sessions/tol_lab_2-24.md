## Description
This session will start with an interactive DNA decision making exercise where attendees will be given the chance to evaluate various QC metrics and decide what further steps should be taken with that sample (i.e. proceed with PacBio library preparation or fail and re-extract). 
This will be followed by a live Q&A session where we invite attendees to ask any questions about our processes and wet lab experiences. 
A panel of scientists with experience with a wide range of different taxonomic groups will be available to answer any questions about the protocols presented, and are happy to be quizzed about any challenging species or sample types that attendees may be struggling with.     

## Prerequisites
