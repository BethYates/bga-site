Exploring Satellite DNA using ModDotPlot

- Alex Sweeten, PhD

## Description
I’d like to give a brief talk on ModDotPlot and how it’s used to visualize tandem repeats. Then I’d like to have attendees run ModDotPlot on a set of “unknown” genome assemblies, and analyze their centromere location, satellite content, and see if there are any misassemblies.
