## Description

We will look deeply at JBrowse 2 from both a user point of view, a configuration point of view, and a developers point of view. 
We will look at all the extensive features of the GUI, and also dig into programmatic details. 
Users will gain a greater understanding of how JBrowse 2 works, and also see features that can be relevant to comparative genomics like synteny views and other advanced view types.
