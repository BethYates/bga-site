title: Frequently asked Questions
---
**Is this free?**  
Yes, bioinformatics tool and resource developers as well as [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org) members worldwide are volunteering their time in the spirit of the EBP.

**How long will a session be?**  
Typically 1 hour, but a few may be 2 hours.

**Do I need to attend all sessions?**  
No, you can attend as many sessions as you like.

**Will registration be restricted?**  
To a degree, some sessions will rely on small groups so that everyone can ask questions and in turn get a reply. These will be first come first serve.

**Will you use Zoom or Teams or Meet or...?**  
We will be using Zoom and will provide all details closer to the event to registered participants.

**How will the community exist outside of the sessions?**  
We will encourage participants to sign up to and use the existing community platforms for each tool. For the live sessions we, in 2023, used Discord so everyone could talk to their *cohort*. We may follow something similar this year too.

**Will I need a powerful computer to participate?**  
No, all you will need is a desktop browser and a GitHub account, as we will use Gitpod.io for sessions that need a linux command line.

**Will sessions be spread/repeated across time zones?**  
Yes, sessions will be repeated at least once across time zones, either live or as a recording (with the opportunity to ask additional questions). We will try to spread them as evenly as possible; however, this may not be possible depending on the location of the host and/or their commitments.

**Will there be assessment/self-assessment?**  
No, these are not formal courses. They are opportunities to learn from the developers and experts in an informal and interactive setting.

**Do I get a certificate?**  
No. See above.

**Who is organising this?**  
The Tree of Life Programme at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK is the main host of Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023. Please contact [[Sujai Kumar]] if you have any questions or suggestions.
