## Planned Sessions

Scheduled sessions are now open for registration. New sessions and repeated sessions will be added to this page, so please keep checking back or **sign up** to be emailed when new/repeat sessions become available.

Detailed session contents will be added over time at this site. Instructions for joining each session will be sent to registered participants.

If there are 2 time slots available for a session, pick the one you can attend more conveniently [in your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20230915&p1=224&p2=41&p3=45&p4=4&p5=37&p6=170&p7=176&p8=33&p9=240&p10=22).

> **2023-08-07 Update**  
> The response to BGA23 has been OVERWHELMING! Thank you üôè **691 booked, 424 waitlisted** ü§Ø Please keep signing up below as we are working with session leaders to add more slots (adding sessions, increasing slots per session, offering recordings with discord discussions, etc). Booked out sessions have a "Join Waitlist" button. Also do **[subscribe/follow](signup.md)** to be the first to be informed when slots open.
>
> **2023-08-11 Update**  
> We are notifying waitlisted participants today by email on how to book extra slots. If you have a confirmed slot already that you can no longer attend, please email tol-training at sanger.ac.uk with your order details so we can free up your slot for other waitlisted participants. Thank you!

  >  - "Pangenome Assembly and Assessment using Minigraph and Bandage" new session added 21 Sep 20:00-22:00
>
> **2023-09-04 Update**  
> Thank you to everyone who attended the first session this morning and kicked off BGA23! Unfortunately (but luckily for the session attendees), five minutes after the session ended, the datacentre that hosts both [BlobToolKit](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org) and [GoaT](https://goat.genomehubs.org) had a major cooling problem and all servers had to be shut down. We don't know when the servers will be back up, so we have postponed both sessions for now, and sent emails to all attendees.
