## Session Leader(s)

Sujai Kumar  
Senior Bioinformatician and Training Coordinator

Rich Challis  
Senior Bioinformatician

Tree of Life Programme, Wellcome Sanger Institute

## Description
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/BGAcademy23/btk-cli)
GitHub:: https://github.com/BGAcademy23/btk-cli

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Install BlobToolKit (BTK) on your own system
2. Starting from an assembly fasta file and a bam file with reads mapped to the assembly, you will be able to create a blobdir and view the BTK plot

## [Session Materials](docs/materials.md)

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with linux command line basics (`cd`, `mv`, `rm`, `wget`, `curl` etc)
2. Understanding of genome assembly concepts such as DNA sequencing, and how short and long sequenced reads are assembled into contigs, scaffolds, and chromosomes
