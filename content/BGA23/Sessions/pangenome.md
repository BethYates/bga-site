Welcome to this data-to-figure workshop on pangenome assembly using minigraph and bandage! In this session you will first get a brief background on the utility of pangenomes, followed by a hands-on tutorial where you will: 

1. construct a pangenome using minigraph and primate mitochondrial genomes 
2. visualize and annotate using bandage 
3. identify lineage specific differences

By the end of this session, you will have all of the tools necessary to curate your genome assemblies into a functional and dynamic reference graph.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, participants will have downloaded the requisite programs: [minigraph](https://github.com/lh3/minigraph), [bandage](http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/), as well as the data fasta [file](https://github.com/cistarsa/BGA-23_MTomics/blob/main/MTranscripts.mfa) of mitochondrial gene transcripts. Experience with GUI point-n-click programs, access and familiarity with terminal and bash command line programming `grep, cd, ls ...etc.`
