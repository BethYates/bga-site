By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Navigate the public [BlobToolKit (BTK) viewer](https://blobtoolkit.genomehubs.org/view)
2. Find BTK plots for your organism(s) of interest
3. See if there are cobionts (contaminants, symbionts, parasites, etc) present in the BTK plots of those genome assemblies

## Prerequisites

1. Understanding the terms genome assembly, reads, contigs
