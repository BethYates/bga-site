## Schedule
### Introduction (30 min)
- What is genome annotation?
    - Current challenges
    - Best practices
- EASEL annotation pipeline

### Running EASEL (10 min)
- Installing dependencies
- Setting parameters
- Submitting a script

### Break (5 min)

### Annotating _Drosophila melanogaster_ with EASEL (1 hr)
- Evidence generation
- Gene prediction
- Secondary and primary feature filtering
- Evaluation
- Benchmarking against commonly used annotation tools

### Questions (15 min)

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Structurally and functionally annotate a eukaryotic genome assembly with EASEL using protein and RNA extrinsic evidence
- Assess non-model genome annotation quality with BUSCO score, mono:multi-exonic ratio, and reciprocal BLAST annotation rate
- Address challenges with accuracy and efficiency for genome annotation

## Prerequisites

This tutorial will provide a walk-through of the EASEL annotation pipeline. If you're interested in running EASEL yourself, you can follow the installation instructions on the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/PlantGenomicsLab/easel).
