It is all well and good having a grand pool of talks and sessions to dive into. However, once you have taken the dive, which direction do you take? Bioinformatics is a rather large topic and so we will be working to create Workshop-tracks. Tracks which offer a realistic and approachable path through a topic.

For example, this collection of workshops would enable an attendee to go from contigs to reference genome:

Could have the pathway:

1. Genome Assembly OR VGP-Galaxy - Assemble your contigs into useable assemblies 

2. TreeVal - Generates tracks, maps and annotations useful for manual curation.

3. Manual Curation - The manual manipulation of your assembly (potentially) into a reference standard genome.
