>This website is still early in development so will not be complete for sometime. If there is anything wrong then please contact me, Damon,  at `dp24[@]sanger.ac.uk`. Likewise if you want to get in early to potentially set up a session, please contact me using the above. A better and more formal form will be available soon!

## What is The BGA?
The Biodiversity Genomics Academy is a series of **free, open to all, online-only, short, interactive** sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org)

BGA was started with [[BGA23]], also found here on the [original site](https://bga23.org/), however, going forward this will be the go to site for all things BGA! All Workshops, talks and guides will be directed to and from here to act as a central point in the eduction of bioinformaticians worldwide!

BGA23 was the test bed, the team (the one man team at the time, [[Sujai Kumar]]) would have been ecstatic with 20 workshops and ~20 each. This culminated in >40 workshops with >1500 attendees. Simply amazing!

For BGA24, we want bigger! More workshops and talks, more attendees, more everything!

To register your interest for the year then, here's a form you can fill in! Once we have our session time table locked in, I'll send out a new questionnaire to ask which ones you'd like to attend.
