Here we are planning the future of BGA, a series of **free, open to all, online-only, short, interactive** sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org) and the field as a whole.

We are actively planning BGA24 right now and we want it bigger and better than last year!

To register your interest for the year here's a form you can fill in! Once we have our session time table locked in, I'll send out a new questionnaire to ask which ones you'd like to attend. This will be so we can gage interest and may run some repeat sessions!

<div data-fillout-id="s3AzWt1p8Nus" data-fillout-embed-type="popup" data-fillout-button-text="Register your interest!" data-fillout-button-color="#00D084" data-fillout-button-size="medium" data-fillout-inherit-parameters></div>

If you already know you want to be a session leader then this is the form for you:

## What is The BGA?

BGA was started with [[BGA23]], found here on the [original site](https://bga23.org/), however, going forward this will be the go to site for all things BGA! All Workshops, talks and guides will be directed to and from here to act as a central point in the eduction of bioinformaticians worldwide!

BGA23 was the test bed, the team (the one man team at the time, [[Sujai Kumar]]) aimed for 20 workshops and ~20 participants each. This culminated in >40 workshops with >1500 attendees. Simply amazing!
